simperialism - A game of ideological warfare

GameBoy 4 Bit

Elements:
	1. The map of Brazikstan (isometric?)
		Province areas: red/gray/blue
		Click to go to province view

	2. The province view (top down)
		You are the spirit of the revolution.
			Inhabit one of
				the intelligencia (beats oligarchs) (unique: Party Leader)
				the military (beats intelligencia) (unique: Generalissimo)
				the oligarchs (beats military) (unique: CEO)
			Once you have your vessel, go forth to destroy the enemy base!
				Speech: draw nearby drones to you

			Engage in combat by proximity

			The unique unit determines the minimum spawn rate for new units
				Party Leader: min 50% intellectuals
				Generalissimo: min 50% military
				CEO: min 50% oligarchs
			The unique unit cannot change unless killed or the REVOLUTION button is pressed
			If REVOLUTION is used, you may select a new unique unit but your spawn rate is 0 for 2 minutes
			Each subsequent revolution doubles the length of the no-spawn period
			Killing the opposing unique unit will prevent them from spawning new units (it is usually in the base though)

			The criminal element will interfere sometimes on the province view

	3. The base view (side scroll)
		Similar to province view, except side scroll perspective
